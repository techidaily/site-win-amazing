## Why does Windows 10 remove inbox printer and scanner drivers?

 That is to say, if you install the operating system with the Windows 10 1809 ISO file, Windows 10 doesn’t include the set of default drivers for printers and scanners as it used to do. This is said to  reduce the Windows footprint and provide more storage space, according to the statement from **[Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-IT-Pro-Blog/What-s-new-in-printing-in-Windows-10-version-1809/ba-p/267182)**  .

### Method 1: Download the printer and scanner drivers manually

 Though Windows stops providing printer and scanner drivers in the installation file, you can still manually download the corresponding drivers via Windows Update or from the manufacturer website. In this case, you’ll need to connect to the Internet after installing the OS.

#### Way 1: Download the driver via Windows Update

 If you upgrade to Windows 10 version 1809 version, your printers that are previously installed will continue to work as before.

 Microsoft removes the drivers for printers and scanners from the ISO, but it moves the drivers to Windows Update. So if you perform a reinstallation or clean installation, you’ll need to access to Windows Update in your computer, then download and install the printer and scanner drivers.

#### Way 2: Download the driver from manufacturer website

 On the other hand, you can also find the driver for your device from the manufacturer’s website.

 You can go to the manufacturer, search for the driver, then download and install the latest version. Be sure to download the driver that is compatible with your OS. The steps vary from printer to printer, so we won’t cover it here. For example, if you’re using an Epson printer, go to Epson Support center, and find the correct driver and install it.

 If this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. There is something else to try.
