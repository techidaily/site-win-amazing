## To update your fingerprint driver in Windows

**[Option 1 â€“ Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fingerprint-driver-download-update-for-windows/#O1)**  â€“ This is the quickest and easiest option. Itâ€™s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks â€“ easy even if youâ€™re a computer newbie.

**OR**

[**Option 2 â€“ Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) â€“ Youâ€™ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Option 1: Update your fingerprint driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the fingerprint driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install**Driver Easy.**

 2) Run**Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 You can also click**Update** to do it for free if you like, but itâ€™s partly manual.  
  
### Option 2: Update fingerprint driver manually

 To update your fingerprint driver manually, youâ€™ll need to go to the manufacturerâ€™s official website (such as **[Synaptic](https://www.synaptics.com/) [s](https://www.synaptics.com/)**  ), find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once youâ€™ve downloaded the correct fingerprint driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 Finally, donâ€™t forget to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
