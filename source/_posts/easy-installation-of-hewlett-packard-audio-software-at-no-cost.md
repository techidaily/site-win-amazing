 Keeping the driver up to date is important for your Epson ES-400 scanner. This ensures that your scanner is running properly. It is easy to update your scanner driver. There are two ways you can do this:

**Download and install your drivers manually** – You can update the scanner driver manually by going to the **[Epson website](https://epson.com/For-Home/Printers/h/h1)**  , and searching for the latest driver for your scanner. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

or

**Download and install your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your scanner driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
