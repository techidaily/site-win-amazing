 Windows sometimes fails to find the latest driver for niche products. If it’s the case, you might need to search in[Asus official site](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking-IoT-Servers/Adapters/All-series/USB-BT500/) and download & install the latest driver manually, or use [Drive Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to update its driver automatically.

### Option 2: Update the Asus USB-BT500 Bluetooth driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Bluetooth driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **Driver Easy** .

 It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact Bluetooth adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 (This requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and[manually install them, the normal Windows way](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .)
