### Option 1 – Update the drivers manually

 ASUS keeps updating drivers for the ASUS ROG STRIX Z370-E gaming motherboard. To get them, you need to visit the **[download website of ASUS](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/ROG-STRIX-Z370-E-GAMING/HelpDesk%5FDownload/)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 of 64 bit) and download the drivers manually. Here’s what you’re supposed to do:

1. Go to the **[download webpage](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/ROG-STRIX-Z370-E-GAMING/HelpDesk%5FDownload/)**  of ASUS ROG STRIX Z370-E gaming motherboard.
2. On the pop-up page, click the**down arrow button** to the right of**Please select OS** to expand its drop-down list, as illustrated below. Then select your version of the Windows operating system.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-272.png)
3. Then you’ll be presented with a list of drivers available for download.**Note** that not all of them are drivers; some are just useful pieces of software which you may download as well.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-275.png)
4. When you decide to download a certain kind of driver, say the audio driver, simply click the**DOWNLOAD** button next to it. You can find more versions (if there’s any) of the desired driver by clicking**See All Downloads** . Then choose one of them to download based on your own situations.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-274.png)
5. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
6. **Reboot** your computer for the changes to take effect even if you’re not asked to.

 Repeat Step 1 through Step 6 until you finish downloading and installing all the drivers you need. This may seem a bit time-consuming and error-prone, though. If you’re interested in the benefits of updating drivers automatically with a driver updater tool, read on and find out how.
