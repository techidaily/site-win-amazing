 You can download and install the driver from the manufacturer ([hp.com](http://www8.hp.com) ).

To install the driver, double click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions.

 HP always releases new drivers in order to keep the printer work effectively. So it’s recommended you often check for the new drivers.
