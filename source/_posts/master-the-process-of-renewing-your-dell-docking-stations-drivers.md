 If this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. There is something else you can do.

### Method 2 – Download and update Samsung EVO 960 driver automatically

3. Click**Update** **All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
