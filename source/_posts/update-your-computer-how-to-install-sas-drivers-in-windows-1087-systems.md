## Choose the way you prefer

 Both options work in**Windows 10/8/7** to help you get the latest Canon drivers. Just decide if you want to do it automatically or manually and take your pick:

1. [**Update your Canon driver automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/canon-drivers-download-update-for-windows-easily/#O1)
2. [**Update your Canon driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### **Option 1: Update your Canon driver automatically (Recommended)**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of **_ALL_**  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

 You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

### **Option 2: Update your Canon driver manually**

 Canon keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to Canon’s official website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

Before heading to download the latest driver package from **Canon**  ‘s official website, we’ll first have to uninstall the old driver first. To do so:

1. Go to **[Canon’s official website](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home)** , type **Canon MF4770n**  in the box, and press   **Enter** .
2. Check out**DRIVERS & DOWNLOADS** under the**Support** section.
3. Type**the name** of your Canon product and click**Go** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa46ed741fe.jpg)
4. Click**DRIVERS & DOWNLOADS** under your model name. (Here I take PIXMA PRO-10 as an example.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa47aad220c.jpg)
5. Make sure **the detected Windows version is the right variant of your Windows OS** and click**SELECT** in**the first** result to make sure to download the latest driver release.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa4841af5d5.jpg)
6. Click**DOWNLOAD** .
7. Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the install. You might want to consult the download & install manual executable file if needed.
8. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
