## What is the GPIO driver?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

## Update AMD GPIO driver

 There are two ways you can update your **AMD GPIO** drivers:

* [Use the AMD driver auto-detect tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Option 1: Use the AMD Driver Auto-detect tool

 The AMD Driver Auto-detect tool is a tool only for Windows 10/7 computers equipped with AMD Radeon discrete desktop graphics, mobile graphics, or AMD processors with Radeon graphics.

So, you can download this tool and use it to update/download your AMD drivers.

1. Go to [AMD support website](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , choose your product and click **Submit** .
