## Enhance Gaming Performance on Windows 11/10 - Secure Nvidia's New Game Ready Graphics Driver Now

You may find your favorite game cannot bring you a better experience as before. This reminds you to update your GeForce Game Ready driver.

## Why do you need to update the Nvidia GeForce Game Ready driver?

 Driver functions as a translator between your device and operating system. The operating system gives a command to your device, but the device can not understand it. Both system and device don’t actually speak the same language so they need a translator – driver. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices but drivers haven’t, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

This is why most of the problems can be solved by updating drivers.

## 2 Methods to update Nvidia GeForce Game Ready driver

 Here are two methods to update your GeForce Game Ready driver: manually and automatically.

1. **[Manually download from the official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Automatically download by Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
