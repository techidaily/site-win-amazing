 Both methods below work in **Windows 10** , **8** and **7** . You may not have to try both; just decide if you want to do it manually or automatically and take your pick:

1. [**Update your Brother MFC7360N driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your Brother MFC7360N driver automatically (Recommended)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Update your Brother MFC7360N driver manually

**A WORD OF WARNING** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to [**Method 2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 According to Brother’s official website, we’ll first have to uninstall the older driver first. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key  ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**  and **R**  at the same time. Then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click   **OK**  .
