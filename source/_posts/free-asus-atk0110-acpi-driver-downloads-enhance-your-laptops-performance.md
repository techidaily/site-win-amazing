![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5979a7235be98.jpg)

 To enhance your PC or game performance, you should**update your NVIDIA graphics drivers** .

 NVIDIA keeps releasing new drivers. You can download the latest driver from the official **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  website. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your NVIDIA driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  

 Or click the**Update** button next to the flagged NVIDIA driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).
