![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bb83cee67a19.jpg)

 Wondering whether or not to update the driver for your **Epson**  printer? Or you know it’s time but still looking for a quick & safe download?

Look no further, this is your guide! ?

## When should I update my **Epson** printer driver

 A printer driver is a tiny program that allows your printer to communicate with your computer.

Updating your printer driver can:

* help prevent crashes;
* improve both your computer and printer performance, etc.

 If your **Epson**  printer is acting a bit _off:_

* error notifications popping up randomly
* not even printing at all, etc.

 So it’s**ALWAYS** recommended to update our printer driver whenever possible.

## Try these methods

 Both methods below work in**Windows 10** ,**8** and**7** .  And as the method list suggests, you don’t have to try both. Just decide if you want to do it manually or automatically and take your pick:

1. [**Update my Epson printer driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update my Epson printer driver automatically (Recommended)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Update my Epson printer driver manually

**A WORD OF WARNING** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise our PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.
