## Way 1\. Download the driver from the official DisplayLink website

 You can choose to download the most recent driver for your Displaylink directly from the official HP website.

 Important: Do not download the driver file from a website you don’t know about its security.

 1) Go to the [**official Displaylink webiste**](http://www.displaylink.com/) .

 2) Locate the driver download page.

 3) Select your operating system. It will takes you to the download page then.

 4) Click the **Download**  next to the most recent version of the driver file.

 5) When it completes downloading, **double-click**  the downloaded **.exe**  file to follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver on your Windows 10.

 6) Restart your Windows computer to make the new driver take effect.

 It’s direct and straight-forward to download the driver from the manufacturer’s website though, it requires your time, patience and the computer technique. If you are not a computer savvy or, you want to do it much faster to save much more time, instead, you can update your HP Envy 5530 driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
