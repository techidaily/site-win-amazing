 Note that depending on the edition of USB-Link 2 you’re using, you may have to manually install or update other drivers:

 If you’re using**USB-Link 2 Wi-Fi Edition** , check if your PC has an up-to-date driver for its wireless network adapter.

 If you have the**USB-Link 2 Bluetooth Edition** , make sure to install or update the driver of your Bluetooth adapter.
