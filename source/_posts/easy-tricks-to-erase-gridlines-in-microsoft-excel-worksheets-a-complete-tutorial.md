 Gridlines make it easier to read through data tables, which is why Excel adds them by default. They aren't always necessary in a spreadsheet, however, so we'll show you how to easily hide them when you don't need them.

 On your Windows PC, [open the Excel spreadsheet](https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-quik-exploring-the-best-pc-video-editing-software-for-gopro-users/) you would like to remove the gridlines from. Once open, click the "View" tab in the ribbon.

 Regardless of which method you choose, the gridlines will be hidden from view. You can show the gridlines again by going to Page Layout > Gridlines, and then checking "View," or by going to the View tab and checking the box next to Gridlines.

 If you don't want to completely hide the gridlines from view but aren't digging light gray color, you can [change the color of the gridlines](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/digital-illusions-mastery-of-partial-picture-softness/).
