## Get the Latest Nvidia GPU Drivers for Windows 10/8/7 Systems – Download Here

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7e946a16130-300x190.jpg) Sometimes Windows changes the way it speaks to hardware. Each time this happens, your drivers need to be updated so they can translate the new commands properly, and your devices will understand them. To have a better display effect, you should update your display driver.

There are two ways to update your Nvidia display driver.

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your display driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/nvidia-display-driver-download-and-install-for-windows/#o2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct display driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
