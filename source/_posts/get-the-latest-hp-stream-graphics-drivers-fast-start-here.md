### Option 2: Update all MSI X470 GAMING PLUS automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t like the idea of keeping an eye on available updates yourself, you may want to update all your MSI X470 GAMING PLUS drivers with **[Driver Easy.](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct GPU driver, onboard audio driver, VGA driver, chipset drivers, etc, and it will download and install them correctly.

 Note that since some updates are meant for the latest version of the Windows system, so we suggest that you perform a Windows Update before heading to the following steps.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
