### Option 1: Update your Arduino Uno driver manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

See how to do it:

 The screenshots below are from Windows 10, but the steps are also valid for other Windows system.

1. Go to the[official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/) . Then go to the**Software Downloads** section.
2. Click**Windows Installer, for Windows XP and up** .

3. Click Just Download. The driver .exe installation file would then be downloaded automatically.

4. On your keyboard, hold down the**Windows logo key** and then press**Pause** .
5. Click**Device Manager** .

6. Find and**right-click** your**Arduino Uno software** . Probably it’s listed under the**Other devices** section due to the problem. Then select**Update driver** .
7. Select**Browse my computer for driver software** .

8. Click the**Browse…** icon. Another window appears: go to the folder with the Arduino uno driver that you just downloaded. Select the drivers folder, then**OK** \>**Next** .

 If you’re prompted by the message that the board has not passed Windows Logo testing, click**Continue Anyway** .

 The Arduino Uno drivers should then be completely installed on your compouter.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Arduino Uno driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Move onto**Option 2** then.
