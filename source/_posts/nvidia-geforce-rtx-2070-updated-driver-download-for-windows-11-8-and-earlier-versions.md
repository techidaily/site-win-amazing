## Choose the way you prefer

 There are two ways you can update your **Killer** network driver for your Windows 10, 8 or 7:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**OR**

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/killer-network-driver-free-download-update-in-windows-10-8-7/#O2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 **Option 1 – Download and update my Killer network driver manually**

 Killer keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to Killer’s official  website, check out the right driver package corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually. (Which could either be an inf file or a zip file).

Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 If you can’t access the Internet, you might have to download the driver package on a computer with workable network and then transfer the file to the target computer to install.
