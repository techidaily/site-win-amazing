 When you are busy working in Microsoft Excel, the last thing you need is to have to continuously fix or remove errors. With that in mind, today's SuperUser Q&A post helps a reader quickly and easily remove pesky number sign errors from his Microsoft Excel sheets.

 Today’s Question & Answer session comes to us courtesy of SuperUser—a subdivision of Stack Exchange, a community-driven grouping of Q&A web sites.

##  The Question

 SuperUser reader M.Hesse wants to know how to get rid of all the number sign (#) errors in Microsoft Excel at the same time:

> When using Microsoft Excel, I usually solve ##### errors by double-clicking the offending column headers. This can become a bit tedious, however, when there are multiple columns displaying the errors at the same time. Is there a quicker way to resolve this?

 How do you get rid of all the number sign errors in Microsoft Excel at the same time?

 Followed by the answer from Raystafarian:

> Yes, on the ribbon go to Home, Cells, and click Format. Once there, you can choose to AutoFit either the Row Height and/or Column Width.

 With our final answer from boflynn:

> For keyboard ninjas, here is a technique that does not require a mouse:
> 
> 1. Select All - Control + A or Control + Shift + 8.
> 2. AutoFit Columns - Hold Alt, then press in sequence O, C, A. You can let go of Alt after you press O.
> 
> This feature, called [Office Access Keys](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-access-keys-from-Office-2003-in-Ribbon-programs-00017F69-0D9B-4A12-A6DA-3F01C61B1593), is a holdover from the pre-ribbon days. If you have memorized the old menus, you can continue to access them this way. In this case, the navigation was:
> 
> 1. Format (O)
> 2. Column (C)
> 3. AutoFit (A)
