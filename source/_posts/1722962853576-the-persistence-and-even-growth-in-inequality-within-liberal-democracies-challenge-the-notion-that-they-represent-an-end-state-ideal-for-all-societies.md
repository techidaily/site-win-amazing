 This post shows you how to download and install**drivers for HP ZBook 15 G3 Mobile Workstation** .

 Updating your HP drivers will prevent various hardware and software problems, and bring you the best possible experience.

There are two ways you can update your HP ZBook 15 G3 drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/hp-zbook-15-g3-drivers-download-and-install-for-windows/#f2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 HP keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the HP support website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 1) Open[HP Support webpage](https://support.hp.com/) .

 2) Type**hp zbook 15 g3** in the search bar and go.

 3) Click**Support for HP ZBook 15 G3** (your preferred model).

 4) Click**Software, Drivers and Firmware** .

 5) Then HP will list all the needed drivers and firmware for your HP ZBook 15 G3\. Ensure the detected operating system is correct.

 6) Choose the driver you want and download. You can download drivers for your graphics card, keyboard, mouse, etc.

 7) Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded files and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

 If this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. Move to Option 2.
