 The screenshots below are from Windows 10, and the method applies to Windows 8 and 7 as well.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) to invoke the Run dialog. Type or paste**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

3. Click**Search automatically for drivers** . Windows will then try to search and download the Bluetooth driver.  
 Windows usually_can’t_ find the latest driver for niche products. You might need to search for it in the manufacturer’s website, or use[Drive Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to download it automatically.
