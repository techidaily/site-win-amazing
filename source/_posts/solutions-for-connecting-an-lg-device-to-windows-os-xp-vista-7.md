## AMD Driver Updates for Windows Users: Focusing on Vista, 7, and Beyond

If you’re using an AMD product (such as an AMD graphics card), to keep it working correctly and ultimate its performance, it’s important that you keep the driver updated.

 This post will guide you through how to download and update AMD drivers in 2 ways, safely and easily.

1. **[Download drivers from AMD official site](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update AMD drivers automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### 1\. Download drivers from AMD official site

 AMD keeps updating drivers. To manually download and install the driver for your hardware, follow the instructions below:

**1)** Go to the **[AMD Drivers and Supports website](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  .

**2)** Search for your product.

**3)** Find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

### 2\. Update AMD drivers automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it (and it uses only genuine drivers, straight from your hardware manufacturer).

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support and a 30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.
