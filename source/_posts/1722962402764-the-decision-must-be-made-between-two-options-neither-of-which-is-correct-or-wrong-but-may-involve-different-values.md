## Option 2 – Update the driver manually

To get the one you need, you should visit the download center of Intel, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the driver manually. Here’re the details (**network connectivity is required** ):

 1) Find your way to the download center of Intel, or you can click here:  
**[Downloads for Intel® 82579V Gigabit Ethernet PHY](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/52963/Intel-82579V-Gigabit-Ethernet-PHY)**

 2) After landing on the page, expand**Filter by** and select the version of your operating system.

This is an example of Windows 10.

 4) Under**Available Downloads** , you can see a number of drivers for different Windows versions. Find the one compatible with your Windows version and click**Download** .
