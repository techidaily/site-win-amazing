###  Fix 1: Download or update StarTech drivers manually

 You can manually download the drivers for your StarTech devices from StarTech Support center.  Before getting started, you should know your StarTech Product ID, which is a combination of letters and numbers. You can find the product ID on the product itself, or you can find it on the packaging or box it came in.  1) Go to[StarTech Driver Download center](https://www.startech.com/support/) .  2) Search for your StarTech driver by entering the**product ID** . For example, you can search  IPUSB2VGA for your Ethernet to VGA converter.
