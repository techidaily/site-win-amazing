## 2 options to update **ScanSnap drivers**

[**Option 1 â€“ Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) â€“ Youâ€™ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**OR**

[**Option 2 â€“ Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/scansnap-driver-download-update-easily/#O2) â€“ This is the quickest and easiest option. Itâ€™s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks â€“ easy even if youâ€™re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 â€“ Update your ScanSnap driver manually**

 Fujitsu keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to Fujitsuâ€™s official  website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once youâ€™ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
