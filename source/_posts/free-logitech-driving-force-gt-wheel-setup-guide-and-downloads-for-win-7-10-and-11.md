 The Logitech Driving Force GT Driver is a program that makes your computer and your racing wheel attached work together.

 If you want to set up the Logitech Driving Force Racing Steering Wheel on your PC, you’ll need to install the correct driver for it.

 Or, if you’ve install the driver for your device, yet somehow your gaming steering wheel won’t work, try updating its driver. This is because gaming wheel issues often occur when you’re using a faulty or outdated driver.

There are 2 ways you can get the correct driver safely and easily:
