### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can go to the[Toshiba support website](https://support.dynabook.com/bluetoothhttp:/support.toshiba.com/bluetooth) , type your model name and find the drivers for your system version, then download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
