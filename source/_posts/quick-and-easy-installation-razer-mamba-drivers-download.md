 If Device Manager says **“The best drivers for your device are already installed”** and you still face the issue, chances are that the driver you’re using is not compatible with your webcam or the system.

## Should I Update My Webcam Driver

 A webcam driver is a computer program that lets your system and your other applications interact with the webcam you use. If the driver is missing, corrupted, or incompatible with your system, your webcam won’t be able to function correctly, or it just won’t work with a specific app. (Likewise, if you’re running into issues with any device, say, your mouse, printer, keyboard, etc., chances are good that something is going wrong with the device driver.) So updating your driver should always be your go-to option when your run into issues on your device.

 But if you’re looking for a speed enhancement of your webcam, updating your drivers probably won’t do the trick for you. What you can expect from an update is very minor performance increases, fix for certain bugs, or maybe a chance to access new features added.
