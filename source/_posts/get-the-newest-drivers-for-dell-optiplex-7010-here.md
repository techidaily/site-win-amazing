**2)** Download the correct and latest driver for your monitor to your computer.

**3)**Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your computer.

You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee** ): **1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** . **2)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)**  Click the **Update**  button next to_your Acer monitor_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install it.
