 Microsoft Excel offers multiple ways to [sum the values of a specific column](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unveiling-instagrams-policies-a-musicians-legal-primer/). You can use the status bar, AutoSum, and the `SUM` function to add up the values in your column. Here's how to use them.

##  Ways to Sum a Column's Values in Excel

 One way to sum a column is to [use Excel's status bar](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/speedy-sonic-tuning-devices-index-pc-tablet-for-2024/). If you only want to see the sum and you don't want to display it anywhere in your spreadsheet, use this method.

 The second method is to use AutoSum, an Excel feature that automatically adds the `SUM` function with its required arguments to your selected cell.

 Lastly, you can use the popular `SUM` function to sum an entire column or specific rows or ranges in it.

##  View Your Column's Sum in Excel's Status Bar

 To only view the sum of your column, then first, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In your spreadsheet, select the cells in your column for which you want to see the sum. To select your entire column, then at the top of your column, click the column letter.

![Select specific cells or the entire column.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1-select-column-excel.png) 

 In Excel's bottom bar, next to "Sum," you'll see the calculated sum of your selected cells.

 Additionally, the status bar displays the count as well as the [average](https://win-able.techidaily.com/fixing-overwatch-startup-issues-how-to-get-rid-of-the-persistent-black-screen/) of your chosen cells.

##  Sum Your Column's Values Using Excel's AutoSum Feature

 To get the sum of the contiguous cells of your column, utilize Excel's built-in AutoSum feature. With this method, you select the cell at the bottom of your column values and access the feature, and then it fills in the `SUM` function with the necessary arguments for you.

 To use it, first, open your spreadsheet and click the cell in which you want to get the result. The feature will add up all the values above the selected cell.

 While your cell is selected, in Excel's "Home" tab at the top, select the "AutoSum" option

![Click "AutoSum" at the top.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/4-excel-autosum.png) 

 In your chosen cell, AutoSum has filled the `SUM` function with your data range. If this looks good, press Enter.

 And you're all set.

##  Sum a Column's Values With Excel's SUM Function

 Excel's `SUM` function is widely used to add up the values in your spreadsheets. You can use this function to add up specific cells, data ranges, and even an entire column. This is the same thing that AutoSum does, but we're going to show you how to type it in manually and modify it to narrow the selection.

 To do that, first, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel and click the cell where you want to see the result.

![Select a cell.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3-choose-cell-excel.png) 

 In your selected cell, type the following function and press Enter. In this function, replace

        `C2:C22`
    
 with [the range](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-chroma-key-techniques-in-live-broadcasts/) where your data is located. If you enter the function as is, it'll add up all the numbers from the

        `C2`
    
 until the

        `C11`
    
 rows.

=SUM(C2:C11)

![Use the SUM function with a data range.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/7-excel-sum-function.png) 

 To count values from specific column cells, add your cells in the `SUM` function separated by a comma as follows:

=SUM(C2,C5,C8)

![Use the SUM function for specific rows.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/8-excel-sum-specific-rows.png) 

 To add a range and specific cells, use the `SUM` function as follows:

=SUM(C2:C5,C8,C10)

![Use the SUM function with a data range and specific cells.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/9-excel-sum-ranges-rows.png) 

 To sum an entire column, use the column letter in the `SUM` function's argument as follows. You'll want to use this function in a cell that's in a different column.

=SUM(C:C)

![Sum an entire column with the SUM function.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/10-excel-sum-entire-column.png) 

 You'll see all the rows added up in your selected cell.
