## Option 1 – Manually

 Graphics card manufacturers will roll out graphics drivers optimized for the latest titles on a regular basis. You can download the most recent correct driver from the **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  driver download page and install it manually.

 Windows Update won’t deliver the latest version. That’s because it categorizes driver updates as either ‘critical’, ‘automatic’ or ‘optional’, and it doesn’t usually concern itself with the ‘optional’ ones.

 Therefore, we recommended that you update your graphics driver either manually or via GeForce Experience, or use a driver updater to do it automatically.
