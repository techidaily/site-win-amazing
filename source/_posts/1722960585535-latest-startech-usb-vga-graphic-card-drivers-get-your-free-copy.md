## Why you need StarTech USB VGA driver?

 StarTech USB VGA external video adapter is the perfect multi-monitor for office applications and internet browsing. This device can be used as an external graphics card for laptop or desktop applications. The adapter can be used up to five adapters to creat multiple VGA connections to extend the desktop on the existing display without open the computer case to add extra video cards.

 The StarTech USB VGA driver enables the smooth connection and functionality between your StarTech USB to VGA adapter and your Windows computer. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems. So you should keep your StarTech drivers up to date in order to have the best experience.
