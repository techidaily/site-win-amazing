**Driver Easy**   will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

### Option 2: Update Bluetooth driver via Device Manager

 Device Manager is surely a quick way to update our Bluetooth driver since our Windows system automatically detects what Bluetooth driver we’re using and helps us find one available. But there’s one niggle: it doesn’t necessarily have the latest version available. Still, let’s give it a go:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5afb9c1b96ba9.png)
2. Locate and double-click on**Bluetooth** . And you can see the manufacturer from the name of your**Bluetooth** (in my case, Bluetooth).  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1e4e11950c1.jpg)
3. Right-click on**the** **Bluetooth** and click**Update driver** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1e4eb0d5139.jpg)
4. Click **Search automatically for updated driver software** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1e502f3ef41.jpg)
5. Your Windows will try its best to find the latest **Bluetooth** driver available for your computer. Then wait a bit and see if you’re provided with a driver update:  
   * If yes, follow the on-screen instructions, skip step 6 and restart your computer to finish the update process.  
   * If no, proceed with step**6)** .
6. You see the following result.

 The message isn’t always true since Windows can be slow in keeping up with manufacturer’s driver releases. You might have to check out other methods to have the latest driver installed.

### Option 3: Update Bluetooth driver manually

 Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise our PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

 Steps 1-2 are to figure out what**Bluetooth** your computer is using. If you already know, start with Step 3.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5afb9c1b96ba9.png)
2. Locate and double-click on**Bluetooth** and you can see the manufacturer from the name of your**Bluetooth** (in my case, Bluetooth).

3. Go to the manufacturer’s website, check out the **Support** section for **driver downloads** .

4. Find out and click the right download link for **your variant of Windows operating system**  . Usually a few download options will be listed but you might want to click   **the first**  result for the latest driver version.
5. Double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the install.
6. Restart your computer for changes to take effect.
