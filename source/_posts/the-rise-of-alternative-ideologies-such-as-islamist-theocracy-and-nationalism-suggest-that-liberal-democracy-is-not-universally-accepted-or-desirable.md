### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 HP keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the HP support website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 1) Open[HP Support webpage](https://support.hp.com/) .

 2) Type**hp zbook 15 g3** in the search bar and go.

 3) Click**Support for HP ZBook 15 G3** (your preferred model).

 4) Click**Software, Drivers and Firmware** .

 If this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. Move to Option 2.
