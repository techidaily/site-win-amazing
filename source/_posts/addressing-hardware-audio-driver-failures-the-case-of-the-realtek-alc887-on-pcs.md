## How to update Microsoft audio driver

 Both methods work in**Windows 10** ,**8** and**7** . And as the method list suggests, you donâ€™t have to try both. Just decide if you want to do it manually or automatically and take your pick:

1. **[Update my Microsoft audio driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update my Microsoft audio driver automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 1: Update my Microsoft audio driver manually

**A WORD OF WARNING** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise our PCâ€™s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If youâ€™re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to[**Method 2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 As it turns out, Microsoft doesnâ€™t provide drivers(except for those built-in generic ones that come in with Windows, which are always subpar). So in order to_manually_ get the right audio update for our computer, you might have to meet at least one of the following requirements:

* Your computer is a branded PC instead of an assembled PC;
* You know exactly what brand and flavor of audio hardware your computer has.

Alright then, letâ€™s get started:

 1) Go to**your branded PCâ€™s official website** or**your audio cardâ€™s manufacturerâ€™s website** (if you know exactly what brand and flavor of audio driver your computer is using).

 2) Check out the**Support** section for**driver downloads** .

 3) Find out and click the right download link for**your variant of Windows operating system** . Usually a few download options will be listed but you might want to click**the first** result for the latest driver version.

 4) Check the downloaded file:

* If itâ€™s an executable(whose name ends in**.exe** ), then go with steps 5) and 6).
* If itâ€™s zip file(whose name ends in**.zip** ), you might have to unzip it first, then go with 7).

5) Double-click on the file to install.

6) Restart your computer for changes to take effect.

7) After the un-zip, see if thereâ€™s an executable(whose name ends in**.exe** )

 If yes, double-click on the .exe file to install. Then restart your computer for changes to take effect.

 If no, then check out **[this link](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for steps to install your audio driver manually.

### Method 2: Update my Microsoft audio driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy**   will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy takes care of it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.
