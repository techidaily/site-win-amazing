### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

**1)** Find your Gigabyte motherboard model name.

 Therefore, if you want to download your Gigabyte ethernet driver, you must find its motherboard information.

**2)** Go to the [Gigabyte official website](https://www.gigabyte.com/us) and look for the Gigabyte motherboard model you have.

**3)** Click **Support** , and select your operating system to find the correct driver.
