##  Option 1: Download and install your driver manually

 To get the correct driver for your headset, you should go to the **[official website of Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/en-us)**  and search for your product. You’ll find the driver for your headset on your product support page. Download it to your computer.

 You should download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

 Once you finish downloading the driver, open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your computer.
