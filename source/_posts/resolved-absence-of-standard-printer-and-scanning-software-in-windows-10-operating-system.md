Here’s how:

1. Click **[here](https://epson.com/Support/Printers/All-In-Ones/WorkForce-Series/Epson-WorkForce-WF-7710/s/SPT%5FC11CG36201?review-filter=Windows+10+32-bit)**  to visit the download webpage of Epson.
2. On the**Downloads** tab, make sure you select the correct version of your operating system.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-440.png)
3. Below you’ll see a category named**Drivers** . Click**Drivers** to expand its drop-down list.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-441.png)
4. Locate the driver that you want to download and click the**Download** button next to it.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-442.png)
5. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file (usually with the EXE extension) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
6. **Reboot** your computer for the changes to take effect even if you’re not asked to.
