## To update your Broadcom WiFi driver

 The following are two methods to update your Broadcom wireless adapter driver

1. [**Manually download the driver from Intel**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your driver automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Manually download the driver from your device manufacturer

 You can download the latest wireless adapter driver from the official website of your computer or motherboard manufacturer. To do so:

**1)** Go to the**official website of your computer or motherboard manufacturer** , then search your_product model_ .

**2)** Download the correct and latest driver for your Broadcom wireless adapter.

 Download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

**3)** Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your computer.

### Method 2: Update your driver automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your wireless adapter driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .

**2)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)**  Click the **Update**  button next to_your Broadcom wireless adapter_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install it. You can also click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
