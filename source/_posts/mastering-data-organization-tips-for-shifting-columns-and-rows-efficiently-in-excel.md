###  Move a Column With Drag and Drop

 With Excel's drag and drop method, you can move your columns around just by dragging and dropping them.

 To use this method, first, find the column you want to move in your spreadsheet. At the top of this column, click the column letter so the entire column is selected.

 Use your mouse or trackpad to bring the cursor to the border of the column. This turns your cursor into a four-arrow icon.

![Move the cursor to the column's border in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2-column-border.png) 

 While your cursor is a four-arrow icon, press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard. Then drag the column to its new location in your spreadsheet. Excel will place your column to the left of the column where you drop it.

![Drag a column in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3-move-column-excel.png)

###  Move a Column With Cut and Paste

 Another way to move a column in your spreadsheet is by cutting and pasting the column.

 To use this method, find the column you want to move in your spreadsheet. Right-click the letter at the top of this column and select "Cut" from the menu.

![An animated dotted line around a column in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/6-dotted-line-column.png) 

 Find the column where you want to place your selected column. Excel will place your cut column to the left of this new column. Right-click the letter of this new column and select "Insert Cut Cells" from the menu.

![Right-click the destination column letter and select "Insert Cut Cells" in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/7-insert-cut-column.png)
