 Use your mouse or trackpad to bring the cursor to the border of the column. This turns your cursor into a four-arrow icon.

![Move the cursor to the column's border in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2-column-border.png) 

 While your cursor is a four-arrow icon, press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard. Then drag the column to its new location in your spreadsheet. Excel will place your column to the left of the column where you drop it.
