 If you're looking to move a column or a row to a different location in your spreadsheet, you have multiple options to do that in Microsoft Excel. We'll show you what those options are.

 To use any of the below methods, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel on your Windows or Mac computer.

##  How to Move a Column in Excel

 To move a column in an Excel spreadsheet, use either [drag and drop](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/mastering-complex-video-effects-and-transitions-in-gopro-studio/) or the cut and paste method.

###  Move a Column With Drag and Drop

 With Excel's drag and drop method, you can move your columns around just by dragging and dropping them.

 To use this method, first, find the column you want to move in your spreadsheet. At the top of this column, click the column letter so the entire column is selected.

![Select a column in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-select-column.png) 

 Use your mouse or trackpad to bring the cursor to the border of the column. This turns your cursor into a four-arrow icon.

![Move the cursor to the column's border in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2-column-border.png) 

 While your cursor is a four-arrow icon, press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard. Then drag the column to its new location in your spreadsheet. Excel will place your column to the left of the column where you drop it.

 And that' it. Your selected column is now available at its new location.

###  Move a Column With Cut and Paste

 Another way to move a column in your spreadsheet is by cutting and pasting the column.

 To use this method, find the column you want to move in your spreadsheet. Right-click the letter at the top of this column and select "Cut" from the menu.

![Right-click the column letter and select "Cut" in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/5-cut-column.png) 

 You'll see an animated dotted line around your selected column. This confirms your column is successfully cut.

 Find the column where you want to place your selected column. Excel will place your cut column to the left of this new column. Right-click the letter of this new column and select "Insert Cut Cells" from the menu.

![Right-click the destination column letter and select "Insert Cut Cells" in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/7-insert-cut-column.png) 

 Your original column will appear to the left of the selected column.

##  How to Move a Row in Excel

 Like with columns, you have a couple of ways to move rows in your spreadsheets. Use either drag and drop or cut and paste to move around your selected rows.

###  Move a Row With Drag and Drop

 To quickly move a row to a new location, use this drag and drop method.

 First, find the row to move in your spreadsheet. Then click that row's number to the extreme left of your spreadsheet.

![Click the row number in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-select-row.png) 

 Hover your cursor over the selected row's borders, and your cursor will turn into a four-arrow icon.

![Bring the cursor around the row's border in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-row-border.png) 

 While your cursor is still a four-arrow icon, press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard. Then drag the row to its new location.

![Drag a row in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/11-move-row-excel.png) 

 Your row is now placed at its new location.

###  Move a Row With Cut and Paste

 If you don't prefer drag and drop, use the cut and paste method to move your rows.

 First, in your spreadsheet, find the row to move. Then right-click this row's number and select "Cut" from the menu.

![Right-click the row number and select "Cut" in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13-cut-row.png) 

 Now find the row above which you want to place your cut row. Right-click this new row's number and select "Insert Cut Cells" from the menu.

![Right-click the target row's number and select "Insert Cut Cells" in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/14-insert-cut-row.png) 

 Your row is now at its new location.
