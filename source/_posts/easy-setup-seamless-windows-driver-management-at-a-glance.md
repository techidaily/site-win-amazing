## Choose the way you prefer

 There are two ways you can update your**Windows** drivers:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**OR**

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 **Option 1 – Download and update my Windows drivers manually**

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your computer’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to **[Option 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

To manually update your Windows drivers:

 First you might need to head to the manufacturer’s official website and search the drivers available for your product model. Then  be sure to **ONLY** choose the driver package corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually.

Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
