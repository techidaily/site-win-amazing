### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Logitech keeps updating the G402 driver. To get the latest driver, you need to go to the **[Logitech official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

## How to Fix Logitech M402 Mouse not Working Issues?

 Apart from a corrupted driver, there’re other reasons that can cause Logitech M402 mouse not working issues.

 First, you may want to check the connection between your mouse and the Unifying receiver. To do so, just remove the receiver from your device and plug it directly and securely into the port.

 Then, you may also want to check if the battery works fine. Try a new battery if you have one available; if you don’t have, just remove the battery for 30 seconds and reinstall it.

 If your mouse still won’t work, then try moving the receiver from one USB port to another to see if that’s an issue with your USB ports.

Lastly, you may want to try your wireless mouse on metal surfaces.
