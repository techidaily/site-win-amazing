### Option 2: Install/Update your RTX 3080 driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can install or update your RTX 3080 driver manually.

 If your PC is having persistent display issues, we recommend you use a [third-party driver updater](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . A professional tool not only updates drivers on your PC, it also _fixes_  those that are either broken or missing altogether.

1. First go to the[NVIDIA drivers download page](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
2. Under the**NVIDIA Driver Downloads** section, search for your graphics card. Be sure to select the correct operating system. Then click**SEARCH** .  
 For**Download Type** , choose**Game Ready Driver (GRD)** for gaming purposes; or choose**Studio Driver (SD)** for graphic design.
