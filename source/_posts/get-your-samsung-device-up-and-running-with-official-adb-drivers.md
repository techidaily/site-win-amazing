## Get Your Samsung Device Up and Running with Official ADB Drivers

If you’re developing an application for the Android platform, you may need to install Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and the driver for it. And if you’re using a Samsung Android cellphone, you should install the Samsung ADB driver.

## To install the Samsung ADB driver on your computer

There are two ways you can use to install the Samsung ADB driver on your computer:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some patience to install the driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/samsung-adb-driver-download/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

### **Option 1 –**  **Download and install the driver manually**

To get the ADB driver , you need to go to the **[Samsung](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows 10 (32 or 64 bit) and download the driver manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
