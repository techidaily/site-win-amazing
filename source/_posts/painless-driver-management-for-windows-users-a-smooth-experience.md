If you want to make sure your**EVGA**motherboard or graphics card is running stably, or if you’re trying to fix their issues, you should keep their drivers up to date.

## To update your EVGA drivers

There are two ways you can use to install the EVGA device drivers on your computer:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some patience to install the driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/evga-drivers-download-and-install-for-windows/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

### Option 1 – Download and install the drivers manually

To get the EVGA driver, you need to go to the official **[EVGA](https://www.evga.com/)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows 10 (32 or 64 bit) and download the driver manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
