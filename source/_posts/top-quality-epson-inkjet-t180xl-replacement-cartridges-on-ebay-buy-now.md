![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bb83cee67a19.jpg)

 Wondering whether or not to update the driver for your **Epson**  printer? Or you know it’s time but still looking for a quick & safe download?

Look no further, this is your guide! ?

## When should I update my **Epson** printer driver

 A printer driver is a tiny program that allows your printer to communicate with your computer.

Updating your printer driver can:

* help prevent crashes;
* improve both your computer and printer performance, etc.

 If your **Epson**  printer is acting a bit _off:_

* error notifications popping up randomly
* not even printing at all, etc.

 So it’s**ALWAYS** recommended to update our printer driver whenever possible.

## Try these methods

 Both methods below work in**Windows 10** ,**8** and**7** .  And as the method list suggests, you don’t have to try both. Just decide if you want to do it manually or automatically and take your pick:

1. [**Update my Epson printer driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update my Epson printer driver automatically (Recommended)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Update my Epson printer driver manually

**A WORD OF WARNING** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise our PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to [**Method 2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

Before heading to download the latest driver package from**Epson**‘s official website, we’ll first have to uninstall the older driver first. To do so:  

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**  and **R** at the same time. Then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc**  into the box and click **OK** .
