## How to get the correct driver?

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your Logitech G402 mouse:

### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Logitech keeps updating the G402 driver. To get the latest driver, you need to go to the **[Logitech official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically install the Logitech G402 driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your mouse driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update**  button next to the Logicool HID-compliant Cordless Mouse to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

## How to Fix Logitech M402 Mouse not Working Issues?

 Apart from a corrupted driver, there’re other reasons that can cause Logitech M402 mouse not working issues.

 First, you may want to check the connection between your mouse and the Unifying receiver. To do so, just remove the receiver from your device and plug it directly and securely into the port.

 Then, you may also want to check if the battery works fine. Try a new battery if you have one available; if you don’t have, just remove the battery for 30 seconds and reinstall it.

 If your mouse still won’t work, then try moving the receiver from one USB port to another to see if that’s an issue with your USB ports.

Lastly, you may want to try your wireless mouse on metal surfaces.
