**[Option 1: Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-driver-for-windows-10-8-or-7/#option1)**  – This is probably the quickest and fastest way to get driver updates. All it takes are a few clicks.

**[Option 2: Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This requires a certain level of computer knowledge. You can choose to install manually if you’re a tech-savvy user.

### Option 1: Get the latest RTX 3060 Ti driver automatically (Recommended)

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
