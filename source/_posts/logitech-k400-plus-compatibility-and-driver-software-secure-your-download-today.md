## Free Download of Logitech K400 Plus Software and Drivers

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-23_11-07-44-1.jpg)

 The Logitech K400 Plus driver runs on your computer, and enables it to communicate with the wireless keyboard you use. Your device won’t fully function if the driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer.

 So, if you’re using a Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 Plus and it’s not working properly now, updating its driver should always be your go-to option.

 There are two ways you can get the latest correct Logitech K400 Plus driver:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically update the Logitech K400 driver (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-logitech-k400-plus-driver-issues/#a)**
* **[Option 2 – Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Option 1 – Automatically update the Logitech K400 Plus driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)**  Click the **Update**  button next to the Logitech K400 Plus driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
