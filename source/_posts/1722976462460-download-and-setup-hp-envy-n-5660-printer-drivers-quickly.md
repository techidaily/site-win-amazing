 Both methods below work in**Windows 10** ,**8.1**  and**7** . And as the method list suggests, you don’t have to try both. Just decide if you want to do it manually or automatically and take your pick:

You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.
