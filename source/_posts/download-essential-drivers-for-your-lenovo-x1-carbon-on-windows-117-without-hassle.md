## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

 Lenovo keeps updating their Thinkpad X230 drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Lenovo Support](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fthinkpad-x-series-laptops%2Fthinkpad-x230%2Fdownloads)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 7 of 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 As Thinkpad X230 has various drivers for its different components such as the wireless network adapter, fingerprint reader and keyboard, you’ll have to download their drivers one by one, which is a bit time-consuming. To update the Lenovo X230 drivers, you may take the following steps:

1. Find your own way to the Lenovo Support website of Thinkpad X230\. Or you can simply **[click here](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fthinkpad-x-series-laptops%2Fthinkpad-x230%2Fdownloads)**  .
2. On the pop-up page, you’ll be greeted with a list of available downloads.**Note** that not all the results are drivers, so you need to make sure what kind of programs you’re trying to download. (And you should also pay attention to their supported Windows versions.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-635.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Click the title of a device to expand its drop-down list. For example, if you would like to download the audio drivers, click**Audio (2)** . In the drop-down list, you’ll see several pieces of software available for download. To figure out their properties, you may click the icon that looks like a**document** to view more details. If you want to download the driver right away, simply click the download button under**Download** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-637.png)
4. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
5. Reboot your computer for the changes to take effect even if you’re not asked to.

2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-439.png)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-629.png)

**Note:** you can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
