## To install the Samsung ADB driver on your computer

There are two ways you can use to install the Samsung ADB driver on your computer:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some patience to install the driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/samsung-adb-driver-download/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

### **Option 1 –**  **Download and install the driver manually**

To get the ADB driver , you need to go to the **[Samsung](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows 10 (32 or 64 bit) and download the driver manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### **Option 2 –  Automatically update the ADB driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the ADB driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**3)**Click the**Update** button next to the ADB driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
