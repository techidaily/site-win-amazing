## How to download the Gigabyte audio driver?

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-gigabyte-audio-driver/#op2) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 Therefore, if you want to download your Gigabyte audio driver, you must find its motherboard information.

**2)** Go to the[Gigabyte official website](https://www.gigabyte.com/us) and look for the Gigabyte motherboard model you have.

**3)** Click**Support** , and select your operating system to find the correct driver.
