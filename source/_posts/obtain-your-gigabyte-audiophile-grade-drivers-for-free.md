### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

**1)** Find your Gigabyte motherboard model name.

 You might be confused: you’re looking for an audio driver, not the motherboard. It’s because all motherboards on the market come with embedded sound cards or onboard audio.  
 Therefore, if you want to download your Gigabyte audio driver, you must find its motherboard information.

**2)** Go to the[Gigabyte official website](https://www.gigabyte.com/us) and look for the Gigabyte motherboard model you have.

**3)** Click**Support** , and select your operating system to find the correct driver.
