## To download and install the iPhone driver on your Windows 10 computer

 Usually, if you connect an iPhone to your Windows 10 computer, your system will automatically download and install the correct drivers for the iPhone. But if that’s not the case for you, or if you want to reinstall those drivers, you will need to download them from a trusted source on the Internet.

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you have an iTunes app installed from Microsoft Store, you may get an message that tells you_your iPhone driver is not installed_ . If so, you should**uninstall the app** before you use Driver Easy to install your drivers. (Your iTunes program will be**reinstalled** after you install the drivers.)
