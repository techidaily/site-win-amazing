 If you’re using a Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel on your PC, make sure you have the correct driver installed for it to function as it should.

 The Logitech G29 software runs on your operating system and enables it to communicate with the racing wheel you’re using.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your Logitech G29 Racing Wheel:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/logitech-g29-driver-download-for-windows-10-8-7/#a2)**
* **[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
