## Download software & driver for your printer

 To download the software and driver for your HP LaserJet Pro M404n, take these steps:

 1) Visit the driver[download page](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-pro-m404-m405-series/19203833/model/19202535) .

 HP Smart is what HP recommends to install when you’re trying to set up your printer. It’s a useful application that makes setting up a printer or troubleshooting printer issues become easier. But if you just need that driver for your LaserJet Pro M404n printer, you can download it in the**Basic Drivers** section.

## Update your printer driver

 When you’re not able to print a document or some of the features are not working as expected, you need to check if your printer driver is out of date or corrupt. While driver updates come with bug fixes and performance improvements. To get the most out of your printer, you’re supposed to update your printer driver.

 There are two ways you can update your printer driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your printer driver

 You can update your printer driver manually by visiting the the manufacturer’s website or go to the Device Manager:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type**devmgmt.msc** and press Enter.  
  
![how to open the Device Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/open-the-Device-Manager.png)

 3) Double-click**Printers** to show the list. Then right-click**HP LaserJet Pro M404n** and select**Update driver** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) Click**Search automatically for drivers** . Then Windows will start updating your driver. You’ll be notified if the update is finished.  
  
![update printer driver via the Device Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/search-automatically-1.png)

 However, you may be told that your driver is already up to date. It’s possible that it still takes time for Microsoft to test and sign the new drivers that just have been submitted. If that’s your case, you can use the driver updater tools such as Driver Easy to automatically update your drivers.

### Option 2: Automatically update your printer driver (recommended)

 If attempting to update drivers via the Device Manager didn’t give you the best results, or if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can instead do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and all your devices, and install the latest correct drivers for you – direct from the manufacturer. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong drivers, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.
