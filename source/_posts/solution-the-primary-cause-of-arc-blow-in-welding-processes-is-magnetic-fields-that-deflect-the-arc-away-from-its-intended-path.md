 This surround sound RGB gaming headset Arctis 5 provides an immersive gaming experience, but sometimes it can bump into issues. And when they do, you can follow[**this troubleshooting guide**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to fix your mic issues, or you can update the Arctis 5 drivers directly.

## How to update Actis 5 drivers

 Actually, you don’t have to install the specific driver to make SteelSeries Arctis 5 work or be recognized successfully. It comes with a plug-and-play feature.

 All you need to have is the generic USB audio driver and the onboard sound driver. Here’s how to do it:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/steelseries-arctis-5-drivers/#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1: Manually update the sound driver

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to open the Run box.

2. Expand the**Sound, video and game controllers** . Then right-click the related devices, and select**Update driver** .
3. Click**Search automatically for drivers** .
4. Windows will start searching for the latest drivers and install them for you.

**Note:** Windows Device Manager doesn’t always detect outdated drivers. Nor does it always give you the latest available version if you update a driver. ([**Learn why…**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) )

 If Windows Device Manager fails to find a new driver for you, you need to source the driver directly from the device manufacturer or use a tool like ours, called **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , to do it automatically.

## Still have audio issues?

 In rare cases, updating your drivers won’t get your problem solved. If unfortunately, updating the SteelSeries Actis 5 drivers didn’t help, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:

### Set your Arctis 5 as the default

 Make sure you have set your SteelSeries Arctis 5 as the default output/input device. Also, select**Set as Default Communications** **Device** .

### Make sure you’ve set it up correctly

 Follow[**SteelSeries Actis 5 setup guide**](https://support.steelseries.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000022031-Setup-Arctis-5) to make sure you’ve done it right. Using the rear ports directly on your motherboard instead of any HUB ports or external hubs will ensure your drivers load correctly, and that the device receives adequate power.
