### Option 2: Update your Wi-Fi driver manually

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

**Important** :**If you can’t access the Internet** , you might first have to download the driver on a computer with workable network and then transfer the file to the target computer to install.**But if you do have Internet access** , do all the steps on the same(target) computer.

1. On the keyboard of the target computer, press  **the Windows logo key**  and   **R** at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc**  into the box and click  **OK**  .
