1. Go to **[Zebra support center](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads.html)**  .
2. Search for your printer model. You can search it from the search box by entering the printer model, or you can do it by navigating to the product list.

This method requires time and computer skill.

 If this solution doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. There are something else to try.

### Method 2: Download or update Zebra printer drivers automatically

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you’ll get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ).

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy in your computer.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download the correct version of the driver (you can do this with the**Free** version). Then install the driver in your computer.  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
