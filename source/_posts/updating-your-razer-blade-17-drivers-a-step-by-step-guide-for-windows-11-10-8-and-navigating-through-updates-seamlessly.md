## Upgrade Your Skills: Painlessly Navigating Through Windows Updates

It’s essential to keep all the drivers for your Windows system up-to-date so that it can run in tip-top shape and nip all sorts of problems like sound not working, computer freezing issues in the bud.

 In this post, we’re going to show you 2 safe and easy ways to get the latest drivers for Windows 10/8/7.

## Choose the way you prefer

 There are two ways you can update your**Windows** drivers:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**OR**

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 **Option 1 – Download and update my Windows drivers manually**

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your computer’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to **[Option 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

To manually update your Windows drivers:

 First you might need to head to the manufacturer’s official website and search the drivers available for your product model. Then  be sure to **ONLY** choose the driver package corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually.

Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 **Option 2 – Download and update my Windows drivers automatically (Recommended)**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Killer network  driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either **[the FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

3. You can upgrade to [**the Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  and click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of **ALL**  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bb5e6c1021eb.jpg) You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. **Restart**   your computer for the changes to take effect.
