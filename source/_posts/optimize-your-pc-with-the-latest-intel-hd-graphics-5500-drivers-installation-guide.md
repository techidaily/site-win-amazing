Device Manager is the easiest way for you to get the updated device drivers, but the down side is, you don’t usually get the latest driver in this way. Still, it worth a shot. 1) Go to [**Device Manager**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). Locate and expand **Display adapters**. Double-click **AMD Radeon RX 480**. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_584f6ee252477.jpg)2) Go to the **Driver**tab, and click **Update Driver…**.
