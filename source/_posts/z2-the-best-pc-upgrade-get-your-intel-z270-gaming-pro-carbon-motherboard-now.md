 If you want to keep your ASRock motherboard working properly, you should make sure the drivers of its devices on your computer are up to date.

## To update your ASRock motherboard drivers

 There are two ways you can update the drivers for the devices on your ASRock motherboard. You don’t have to try them all; just choose the right one for you.

1. [**Get your motherboard drivers from the ASRock website**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your motherboard drivers automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Get your motherboard drivers from the ASRock website

 You can download the driver for your devices from the official website of your hardware manufacturer. Here’s how you can do it:

**1)** Go to the **[official ASRock website](https://www.asrock.com/)**  , then search your motherboard product.

**2)** Go to the driver download page for your motherboard, then download the correct and latest drivers for it.

 Download the right drivers for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s**Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version** , etc.

**3)** Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver on your computer.
