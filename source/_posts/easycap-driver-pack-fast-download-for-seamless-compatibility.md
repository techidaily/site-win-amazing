## Download Compatible Drivers for Ryzen Family of CPUs & GPUs – 2023 Edition

Are you looking for the latest chipset update fro your Ryzen motherboard? If you do, you’ve come to the right place. It’s important to ensure you’ve got the latest drivers to improve your computer.

## Why you need Ryzen chipset drivers?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why most of the problems can be solved by installing/updating drivers.

There are two ways you can update your network adapters drivers.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
