### Option 2 – Update your wireless network adapter driver manually

 If you feel like updating the wireless network adapter driver manually, here’s the simple and useful guide for you.

#### Update your driver via official websites

 Manufacturers of wireless network adapters such as Qualcomm keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to visit their official websites, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 of 64 bit) and download the drivers manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Update your driver via Device Manager

 One of the most commonly used methods to update your driver is downloading and installing it via Device Manager. However, you should note that sometimes Windows may **fail to detect the latest (and even necessary) driver for your device** . In this case, you’ll have to search for the correct driver online or simply turn to **[Option 1](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. Press the**Windows Logo Key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-255.png)
2. Here comes the window of**Device Manager** . Double-click on the **Network adapters** node to expand its drop-down list. Then right-click on your wireless network adapter and select**Update driver** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-257.png)
