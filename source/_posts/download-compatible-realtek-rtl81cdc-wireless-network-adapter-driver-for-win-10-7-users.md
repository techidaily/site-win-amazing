 If you’re using an HP laptop or desktop computer and want to download the latest driver for your network adapter, there’re two ways you can do so:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/hp-network-driver-download-for-windows-10-7-8/#o2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Hardware manufacturers keep updating drivers. To get the latest driver for your network adapter, you need to go to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and search for the latest driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
