## Why you need to update your driver

 Drivers are essential to the computer. They function as a bridge between your devices and the computer. Without them, there’s a high chance your devices won’t work as expected.

 Driver updates often feature some major bug fixes and performance boost, that’s why we recommend you to update your driver.
