## Pick the way you prefer

**[Option 1: Manually –](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2: Automatically (Recommended) –](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-download-epson-xp-830-driver-solved/#o2)** This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1: Download Epson XP-830 driver manually from Epson

Epson keeps updating drivers, including Epson XP-830 printer driver. Here’s how you can get it:

2. Type**Epson XP-830** , then select Epson XP-830 from the pop-up result.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5ba1e8fe3721f.png)
3. Choose your system type. Then you can choose to download the Epson recommended Drivers and Utilities Combo Package Installer or, just download the driver under the Drivers section.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5ba1e94c2f81b.png)

Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver, double-click on the downloaded driver file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2: Download Epson XP-830 driver automatically through Driver Easy
