## 2 ways to update your Microsoft Bluetooth driver

 Here’re two methods to update the Microsoft Bluetooth driver. You can choose one according to your preference.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/microsoft-bluetooth-driver-download-and-update/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the Microsoft Bluetooth driver manually

 Microsoft keeps releasing new drivers for its Bluetooth devices. To get them, you need to go to the **[Microsoft download center](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/downloads)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
