 First, open your spreadsheet and type your text until you need a new line.

![Type text in a cell in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-type-text.png) 

 While your cursor is still in the cell where you were typing, press Alt+Enter (Windows) or Option+Enter (Mac). This will start a new line in your cell, and you can continue to type the rest of the text.

##  Start a New Line in an Excel Cell With a Menu Option

 Another way to start a new line in an Excel cell is to use the Wrap Text feature. With this feature, you select the cells in which you want new lines and the feature automatically adds the required lines.

 To use the feature, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. Then select one or more cells where you want the text to fit the size of the cell's width.
