 **Lenovo ThinkPad T420s** is a rather old model of computer. You will see the notification telling you that it is “**no longer available for purchase on lenovo.com** ” even if you want to purchase it now.  
  
 That being said, it is not easy for you to find solutions to its driver problems when they occur when you are a Windows 10 user. To save you countless time and energy, we will guide you through the whole process of getting the device drivers downloaded and updated with step-by-step and easy instructions, so, choose accordingly the right way for you!
  
[**Method One: Update T420s device drivers via device manager**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Method Two: Update T420s device drivers manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_583d2800916a1.png)
