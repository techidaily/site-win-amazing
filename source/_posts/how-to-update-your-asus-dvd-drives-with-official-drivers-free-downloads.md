## How to Update Your ASUS DVD Drives with Official Drivers - FREE Downloads

Your Asus DVD drive is not working well after upgrading to Windows 10? It’s probably a driver problem. Your DVD driver is probably missing or out of date (and therefore incompatible with Windows 10).

 So it’s usually a pretty quick fix. Most of the time, you just need to update your audio driver. Here’s how…

**[STEP 1 – Confirm it’s a driver problem](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
**[STEP 2 – Update your audio drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## STEP 1 – Confirm it’s a driver problem

 To confirm if your DVD drive problem is caused by driver issue, you need to check for the driver status in Device Manager:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and click **OK** . This will start the Device Manager.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dvd1.jpg)
3. In Device Manager, click**View** and then select**Show hidden devices** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dvd.jpg)
4. Expand**DVD/CD-ROM drives** , if you see a yellow mark next to the device name (usually an exclamation or a question mark), there’s a problem with the driver, and you need to update it.
