On AMD website, **Radeon RX 470** is said to be “gamer optimized”, “future ready”, and “strap in for high visuals and high frame rates”. Sound very tempting and intriguing.

[**Option One: Update in Device Manager**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Option Two: Update Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 **Option Two: Update Manually**
