## Method 1: Download and update the driver manually

 If you prefer to download drivers manually, you can download and update your Logitech wireless keyboard driver manually from Logitech official website:

 1) Go to[Logitech Download page](http://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads)  .  
  
 2) Type your Logitech wireless keyboard model name in the search box and click the **More**  button for more content. (Let’s take K400 for example.)

 5) After the download completes, just double-click on the downloaded file (.exe) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.  

## Method 2: Download and update the driver automatically
