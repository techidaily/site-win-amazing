## Why you need to update your driver

 Drivers are essential to the computer. They function as a bridge between your devices and the computer. Without them, there’s a high chance your devices won’t work as expected.

 Driver updates often feature some major bug fixes and performance boost, that’s why we recommend you to update your driver.

## How to download and update your HP Scanjet driver

Here’re 2 ways you can download and update your HP Scanjet driver:

1. **[Download the HP Scanjet driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Download and update the HP Scanjet driver automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/hp-scanjet-drivers-download-and-update-on-windows/#option2)**

### Option 1: Download the HP Scanjet driver manually

 Manufacturers always release the drivers for their product on the**official website** . So, to manually install/update the driver for HP Scanjet, follow these steps:

 1) Visit the[official HP website](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04635830) , and scroll down until you see your model. Here we take**HP ScanJet Pro 3500 f1** as an example:

 We recommend downloading**HP ScanJet Pro 3000 s3 Full Feature Software and Driver** , just so you’ll enable all the features of your scanner.
