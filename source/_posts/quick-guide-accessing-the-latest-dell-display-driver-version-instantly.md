## Update to the Newest Dell Wireless Network Driver Version Instantly

It’s important to keep the wireless adapter driver up to date on your Dell computer. This ensures the stability of your WiFi network connection.

## To update your Dell WiFi driver

 There are two ways you can update the wireless adapter driver on your Dell computer:

1. [**Download the driver from the Dell website**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your wireless adapter driver automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
