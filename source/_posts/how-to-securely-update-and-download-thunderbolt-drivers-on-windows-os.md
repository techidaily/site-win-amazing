2. [**Update your Corsair Void Pro driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Option 1: Update your Corsair Void Pro driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04aae3578ee-1.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _**ALL**_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5bfa4f05e9160.jpg) You can also click **Update**  to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
