## Option 1: Manually update your Lenovo ThinkPad drivers

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find the exactly right drivers online, download them and install them step by step.

 You can first head to **[Lenovo’s official website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2F)**  and select your model of Lenovo ThinkPad. Then check out the section for driver downloads and search for the specific drivers you want to update. **Be sure to choose only drivers that’re compatible with your flavor of Windows version,** and then download and install them manually.

Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
