## 2 ways to install the RTX 2070 SUPER drivers

 Option 1:[Install manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – This will take time and computer skills. You need to visit the NVIDIA website, find the drivers and install step by step.

**OR**

 Option 2: **[Install automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-update-rtx-2070-super-drivers-windows-10/#option2)**  – Download & install the drivers automatically and correctly. All you need is a just few clicks.

### Option 1: Install the RTX 2070 SUPER drivers manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can try to install the RTX 2070 SUPER manually.

To do so, you can follow these steps:

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can make your PC unstable and even crash the whole system. So please proceed at your own risk.

1. Go to the[**driver download page**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of the NVIDIA website. Then search for your graphics card.

### Option 2: Install the RTX 2070 SUPER drivers automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
