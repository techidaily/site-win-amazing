## **What is Nvidia 3D Vision?**

 Nvidia 3D Vision is a stereoscopic gaming kit. It uses LC shutter glasses and driver software to deliver stereoscopic 3D images for any Direct3D games and movies.

## How do I update my Nvidia 3D Vision driver?

There are two ways to update your Nvidia 3D Vision driver:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your Nvidia driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/nvidia-3d-vision-drivers-download-and-update-for-windows/#o2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install your Nvidia 3D Vision driver manually

 Nvidia keeps updating drivers. To get the latest driver for your Nvidia 3D Vision, you need to go to the **[Nvidia website](https://www.geforce.com/drivers)**  , search the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download it manually.
