## To update your Dell WiFi driver

 There are two ways you can update the wireless adapter driver on your Dell computer:

1. [**Download the driver from the Dell website**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your wireless adapter driver automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Download the driver from the Dell website

 You can get the driver for your wireless adapter from the official Dell website. To do so:

1. Go to the **[official Dell website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2F)**  , then search your_computer model_ .

2. Go to the driver download page for your computer, then download the correct and latest driver for your wireless adapter.  

 Download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver on your computer.
