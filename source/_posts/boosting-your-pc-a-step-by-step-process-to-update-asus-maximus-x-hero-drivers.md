### **Option 2: Update your Surface Book drivers manually**

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

And unless you know the exact drivers to search and the variant of your Windows Operating System, it can present certain levels of difficulty.

1. Go to **[Microsoft Surface Book Products Help](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/hub/4295272/surface-book-products-help)**  .
2. Scroll down to the Help list, then click**Install and update** \>**Download drivers and firmware for Surface** .

 Be sure to choose**ONLY** drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
